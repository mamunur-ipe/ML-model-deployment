This machine learning API will receive data from users and make prediction on: 

(A) Wart treatment success by Cryotherapy and Immunotherapy methods 
(B) Early diagnosis of breast cancer

Wart treatment success prediction: Cryotherapy and Immunotherapy are two common treatment methods for warts. The treatment success may vary patient to patient. This application will feed the user input data into a trained machine learning model and predict the probability of treatment success for the above two treatment methods for better decision making.

Breast cancer prediction: Early detection of breast cancer can save life. This application will receive data from a user, which can be attained easily from regular blood test. The input data will be fed into a trained machine learning model and make prediction regarding the probability of having breast cancer.

Movie Recommender: An user will input his/her favorine movie in the system and this app will recommend another five movies the user might watch.
